## Lyrics
```

[CHORUS 1]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 1]
preach words, they don't mean a thing
same a thing same to _everyone_
say it through the tears (tears)

different everything, no simple minds
that's where hate comes in 
who knows (when) - 
what next day\ll bring

again
the chosen one, fast to reap
just for you to trust me (i say)
painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all waste among order
throttle fully bent (done) no hidden layers 
just the grief, truly only thing 
is my own cause, own charge own retreat

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 2]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 2]
that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit,
no hard feelings
truly telling another 
one is amidst
foretelling round the corner

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 3]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

in the end
such a lowlife

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 3 - SIIMLAR TO CHORUS]
cauterized wound on diehards 
always find ways to heal  
i only wanted no masks no guides
no secret moves aye ya (reverb)

x
x
x heavy toll paid
let us live in colorized world
all i want is you
until both our souls are through

x
x
decent neutral
anything ?

-

authorized drugs with no card sign
ending wanted not bad no life no 
such a lowlife

nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need to break things when I steer myself
sometimes new

-

just to grasp the heart of ice
feel the warmth of my tribe
sometimes it's the ashes that remain 
when you notice only flaws 
internal cause - 

x
x
x heavy toll paid
all i want is you
let us live in
a beautiful world
until our souls are through

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 4]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

chorus again fades out into silence
