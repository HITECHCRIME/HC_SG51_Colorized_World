## Lyrics
```
(aaaooooooooouuuu)
colorized world
colorized world
(sing)

(aaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuu)
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye

[CHORUS]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya

preach words, they don't mean a thing
same thing not to everyone just for you
the chosen, so fast to reap

painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all the waste among order
4 and 20 deep, throttle fully bent
round my knees (down my knees?)

[VERSE 1]
heavy toll paid all i want is you
all you are but let us live in colorized world
till both our souls are through

just to grasp the heart of ice, melting thrice
feel the vibe warmth, calm of my tribe's might
sometimes it's the ashes that remain 
when you notice 

only flaws (in your soul)
inner cause internal
heavy toll paid,  
feeling raw weight
heavy toll paid all i want is you
beautiful dark world 

let us live in cold
until our souls are through 
i swear on our both lives

(it's a colorized 
colorized world)

cauterized wound on diehards 
always find ways to heal only wanted
no masks no guides no secret moves aye 
ya (reverb)

authorized drugs with no card sign
ending wanted not bad say it 
i have no life such a lowlife ya

upping gear will bring the light close 
bring the light (to us)
that's when the colours come out
bring the light close aye

(yaaaaooooooooo-ooooouuuuuuuuuu)

that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit, no hard feelings
truly telling foretelling round the corner
one twin flame is amidst
(i miss ya, did anybody get it right yeah?)

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya

preach words, they don't mean a thing
same thing not to everyone just for you
the chosen, so fast to reap

painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all the waste among order
4 and 20 deep, throttle fully bent
round my knees (down my knees?)

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 2]
make it clear to trust me 
i say, say it - through the tears hun ------------(yeah)
- then again twin soul seperate flames
different vector's where the hate resides
no simple mind who knows it, weapons drawn next-------(annuls it)
what day'll bring ------------------(it was day'll) (this is) should (long)
no hidden layers just the grief
truly only thing is my own cause 
own charge own retreat, steady ground
i have no words other than be in peace 
let me be in peace, rest in peace yeah

(colorized
colorized world)

might as frog ana neyya 
booorii
i don't wanna nod 
i'm not so mad 
to not
get it right

no don't
rush aye

upping gear will bring the light (close)
bring the light (to us)
that's when the colours come out
bring the light close aye

(fades)

upping gear will bring the light close 
bring the light (to us) that's when the colours come out
bring the light close aye

<the singing part>yee eeee uuuu-uuuuuuu (annfran)

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya

preach words, they don't mean a thing
same thing not to everyone just for you
the chosen, so fast to reap

painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all the waste among order
4 and 20 deep, throttle fully bent
round my knees (down my knees?)



N O T E S

SHORTEN IT ALL?
[CHORUS 4]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

chorus again fades out into silence

in the end
such a lowlife
expect a diss

(autotune) nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need breaking things when I steer myself
sometimes new (?)
 
when I steer myself
sometimes new
(autotune)

nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need breaking things when I steer myself
sometimes new (?)
 
when I steer myself
sometimes new

## Music Video

Meditating (drone footage), connection with other minds while raging inside with emotions.
Mixed with some techwear swag footage + like in the reference graphic - hugging a girl, my face hidden by her hair floating in the air, grasping for each other in red light (motif: danger, aggression).
