## Lyrics
```

[CHORUS 1]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 1]
preach words, they don't mean a thing
same thing not to everyone just for you ///// same thing not to you, not everyone
the chosen, soo fast to reap ya

painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all the waste among order (20/20)
4 and 20 deep, throttle fully bent
round my knees

make it clear to trust me (i say)
say it - through the tears hun (hun)
- then again twin soul seperate flames
different vector where the hate resides

(different vector where the sparks of hate reside)
(different context where the hate resides)
different set, that is where hate comes in ------------------------- used to be context
(different vector context where the hate comes in) 

no simple mind who knows it, weapons next (annuls it) (when) 
what long day'll bring ya (reverb) ------------------- what the day'll bring

no hidden layers just the grief
truly only thing is my own cause 
own charge own retreat, steady ground
i have no words other than be in peace 
let me be in peace, rest in peace yeah


-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 2]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 2]
that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit,
no hard feelings
truly telling 
one twin flame is amidst
foretelling round the corner
expect a diss


-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 3]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

in the end
such a lowlife

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 3 - SIIMLAR TO CHORUS]
cauterized wound on diehards 
always find ways to heal  
i only wanted no masks no guides
no secret moves aye ya (reverb)

x
x
x heavy toll paid all i want is you
let us live in colorized world
till both our souls are through

x
x
decent neutral
anything ?

-

- authorized drugs with no card sign
ending wanted not bad no life no 
such a lowlife

nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need breaking things when I steer myself
sometimes new

-

just to grasp the heart of ice
feel the warmth of my tribe
sometimes it's the ashes that remain (in your soul)
when you notice only flaws 
internal cause - 
heavy toll paid all i want is you
beautiful dark world let us live in cold

until our souls are through i swear on both our lives
upping gear will bring the light close bring the light to us

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 4]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

chorus again fades out into silence

```

## Music Video

Meditating (drone footage), connection with other minds while raging inside with emotions.
Mixed with some techwear swag footage + like in the reference graphic - hugging a girl, my face hidden by her hair floating in the air, grasping for each other in red light (motif: danger, aggression).
