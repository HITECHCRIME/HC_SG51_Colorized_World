## Lyrics
```

[CHORUS 1]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

[VERSE 1]
preach words, they don't mean a thing
same a thing same to everyone 
say it through the tears (tears)
different everything, no simple minds
that's where comes in hate
who knows what next day will bring
the chosen one, fast to reap
just for you to trust (i say)
painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all waste among order
throttle fully bent (done) no hidden layers 
just the grief, truly only thing 
is my own cause, own charge own retreat

[CHORUS 2]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

[VERSE 2]
that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit,
no hard feelings
truly telling another 
one is amidst
round the corner

[CHORUS 3]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

in the end

[VERSE 3 - SIIMLAR TO CHORUS]
cauterized wounds
always find ways to heal
i only wanted
no masks no guides
no secret moves

ay ya

just to grasp the heart of ice
feel the warmth of my tribe
sometimes it's the ashes
that remain when you notice
only flaws - decent neutral
anything ?

preach words
they don't mean a thing
same thing thing to everyone


[CHORUS 4]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

chorus again fades out into silence

```
