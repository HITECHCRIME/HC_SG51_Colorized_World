# HC_SG51_Colorized_World
Hitech Crime Single "Colorized World"
Rich The Kid x Offset Type Beat - Peak

[CHORUS]
colorized world
with no scars
i only wanted
no wars no fights
no separate worlds 

aye ya (reverb)

often (no) words make
our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing
is what i tell myself
every day 

ya (reverb)

[VERSE]
preach words
they don't mean a thing
same thing thing to everyone   
say it through tears
no simple minds
that's where comes in hate
who knows what next day will bring

x
x
the chosen one fast to reap
just for you 
(i say)

trust
painting grey
on a masterpiece
seeking all waste
among  order
throttle fully bent (done)

that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit,
no hard feelings
truly telling another 
one is amidst
round the corner

no hidden layers 
just the grief 

truly only thing 
is my own cause
own charge own retreat 

[CHORUS]
colorized world
with no scars
i only wanted
no wars no fights
no separate worlds 

aye ya (reverb)

often (no) words make
our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing
is what i tell myself
every day

aye ya (reverb)

[VERSE]
preach words
they don't mean a thing
same thing thing to everyone

cauterized wounds
always find a way to heal
