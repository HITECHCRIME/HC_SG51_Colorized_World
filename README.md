## Lyrics
```

[CHORUS 1]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 1]
preach words, they don't mean a thing
same a thing same to everyone 
just for you the chosen one, 
fast to reap, different everything, 
that's where hate comes in 
no simple minds who knows (when) - 
what next day'll bring ya

painting grey on a masterpiece
seeking all waste among order
throttle fully bent, 

make it clear to trust me (i say)
say it through the tears (tears)
then again twin soul seperate flames

truly only thing is my own cause 
own charge own retreat

no hidden layers
just the grief

x
x
x


i have no words other than be in peace (rest in peace)


-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 2]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 2]
that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit,
no hard feelings
truly telling 
one twin flame is amidst
foretelling round the corner
expect a diss


-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 3]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

in the end
such a lowlife

-----------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 3 - SIIMLAR TO CHORUS]
cauterized wound on diehards 
always find ways to heal  
i only wanted no masks no guides
no secret moves aye ya (reverb)

x
x
x heavy toll paid
let us live in colorized world
all i want is you
till both our souls are through

x
x
decent neutral
anything ?

-

authorized drugs with no card sign
ending wanted not bad no life no 
such a lowlife

nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need breaking things when I steer myself
sometimes new

-

just to grasp the heart of ice
feel the warmth of my tribe
sometimes it's the ashes that remain (in your soul)
when you notice only flaws 
internal cause - 
heavy toll paid all i want is you
beautiful dark world let us live in cold

until our souls are through i swear on both our lives
upping gear will bring the light close bring the light to us

-----------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS 4]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

chorus again fades out into silence

```
