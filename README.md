# HC_SG51_Colorized_World
Hitech Crime Single "Colorized World"
Rich The Kid x Offset Type Beat - Peak

colorized world
with no scars
i only wanted
no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye  (no simple minds)

often words make
our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing
is what i tell myself
every day

preach words
they don't mean a thing
same thing 
same thing to everyone
just for you
the chosen one
fast to reap

painting grey
on a masterpiece
seeking all waste
among  order
throttle fully bent

no hidden layers 
just the grief 
truly only thing 
is my own cause
own charge own retreat 
that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit, no hard feelings
truly telling another one is 
amidst round the corner
