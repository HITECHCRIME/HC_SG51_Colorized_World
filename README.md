## Lyrics
```
(aaaooooooooouuuu)
COLORIZED WORLD
COLORIZED WORLD 
(sing)

(aaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuu)
COLORIZED WORLD WITH NO SCARS
I ONLY WANTED NO WARS NO FIGHTS
NO SEPARATE WORLDS AYE

[CHORUS]
COLORIZED WORLD WITH NO SCARS
I ONLY WANTED NO WARS NO FIGHTS
NO SEPARATE WORLDS AYE YA

OFTEN WORDS MAKE OUR DIMENSIONS 
FEEL COLD I DON'T FEEL A THING 
IS WHAT I TELL MYSELF EVERY DAY YA

PREACH WORDS, THEY DON'T MEAN A THING
SAME THING, NOT TO EVERYONE 
JUST FOR YOU THE CHOSEN, SO FAST TO REAP
PAINTING GREY ON A MASTERPIECE
SEEKING ALL THE WASTE AMONG ORDER
4 AND 20 DEEP, DOWN MY KNEES

------------------------------------------------
 
[VERSE 1]
trust your (+) own drive
purpose tracking (- why not) active
swear on both our lives 
through the specters 
i emerge eye to eye

laser line of sight
line of understanding 
throttle fully bent
(with) - one step and breath
yeah - come alive

HEAVY TOLL PAID
FEEL THE - WARMTH OF MY TRIBE (?)
SAME SPECIES, RAREST KIND - ha!
JUST TO GRASP THE HEART OF ICE - ya!
it will melt the dark inside  - vow!
TRIBE'S PRESENCE CALMS, FLAME OF SPIRITS AGES OLD 
OUT OF SPECTRUM, VIVID MEMORIES, 
GOT NO COLOURS GOTTA HINT
rest your head sometimes yeah  (?)

IT'S THE DIGITS THAT REMAIN, 
INNER CAUSE, YOUR'RE IN ASHES 
WHEN YOU NOTICE ONLY FLAWS
IN YOUR SOUL YEAH

WHEN YOU NOTICE ONLY FLAWS 
IN YOUR SOUL YEAH

not to worry tho
you will keep me right

no grey void 
to fill my head (breathe)

let us live in cold
until our souls are through 
i swear on our both lives
upping gear brings the light - close 
brings the light - to us
that's when the colours come out
retina's warped, still going forward
bleeding from my thoughts

(it's a colorized 
colorized world)

CAUTERIZED WOUNDS ON DIEHARDS 
ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO HEAL 
ONLY WANTED NO MASKS NO GUIDE
NO SECRET MOVES AYE YA

AUTHORIZED DRUGS WITH NO CARD SIGN
ENDING WANTED NOT BAD, USED TO SAY
I HAVE NO LIFE, SUCH A LOWLIFE YA

upping gear will bring the light - close 
brings the light to us
that's when the truest colours come out
so bring the light close to me aye

(yaaaaooooooooo-ooooouuuuuuuuuu)

armed with courage 
see it through
look into my eyes 
your not seeing grey
your energy raw in weight
internal beautiful dark world 
filled with hope
that's what's left to miss 
grand plan won't hit, no hard feelings
truly telling foretelling round the corner
one twin flame is amidst
(i miss ya, did anybody get it right yeah?)

------------------------------------------------

[CHORUS]
COLORIZED WORLD WITH NO SCARS
I ONLY WANTED NO WARS NO FIGHTS
NO SEPARATE WORLDS AYE YA

OFTEN WORDS MAKE OUR DIMENSIONS 
FEEL COLD I DON'T FEEL A THING 
IS WHAT I TELL MYSELF EVERY DAY YA

PREACH WORDS, THEY DON'T MEAN A THING
SAME THING, NOT TO EVERYONE JUST FOR YOU
THE CHOSEN, SO FAST TO REAP

PAINTING GREY ON A MASTERPIECE
SEEKING ALL THE WASTE AMONG ORDER
4 AND 20 DEEP, THROTTLE BENT DOWN MY KNEES

------------------------------------------------

[VERSE 2]
MAKE IT CLEAR TO TRUST ME I SAY
SAY IT THROUGH THE TEARS YEAH (hun)
- THEN AGAIN TWIN SOULS SEPERATE FLAMES

DIFFERENT VECTOR'S WHERE THE HATE RESIDES
NO SIMPLE MIND WHO KNOWS IT, WEAPONS DRAWN TO (annuls it)
WHAT THE DAY'LL BRING (it was day'll) (this is) should (long)

NO HIDDEN LAYERS JUST THE GRIEF
TRULY ONLY THING IS MY OWN CAUSE 
OWN CHARGE OWN RETREAT - STEADY GROUND
I HAVE NO WORDS OTHER THAN BE IN PEACE 
LET ME BE IN PEACE, REST IN PEACE YEAH

it's a
(colorized
colorized world)

might as frog ana neyya 
booorii
i don't wanna nod 
i'm not so mad 
to not
get it right

rush aye

upping gear will bring the light - close 
brings the light to us
that's when the truest colours come out
so bring the light close to me aye

(fades)

upping gear will bring the light - close 
brings the light to us
that's when the truest colours come out
so bring the light close to me aye

N O T E S

throttle fully bent, null void 
heavy toll paid to fill my head - breathe
with one breath and sight i come alive
feeling someone's drive, purpose tracking active
let me guess as i swear on both our lives
(just to grasp the heart of ice it will melt its dark)
just to grasp the heart of ice, melt its dark (melting thrice) (dark)
feel the warmth of my tribe, same species, rarest kind
feel(ing) the vibe's warmth, calm of my tribe's might
flame of the spirits ages old - rest sometimes 
it's the ashes when you notice only flaws (in your soul)
inner cause, it's the digits that remain
through your specters i emerge
eye to eye, laser line of sight, 
line of understanding 
connection is still stable 
when you watch me 
steer myself sometimes new 
armed yourself with courage to see it through
look into my eyes tell me your not seeing grey
internal beautiful dark world 
your raw energy in weight
filled with hope
(feeling raw weight)

(heavy toll paid all i want is you
all you are but let us live in colorized world
till our souls are through)

decent neutral
anything ?

SHORTEN IT ALL?
[CHORUS 4]
colorized world with no scars
i only wanted no wars no fights
no separate worlds aye ya (reverb)

often words make our dimensions feel cold
i don't feel a thing is what i tell myself 
every day ya (reverb)

chorus again fades out into silence

in the end
such a lowlife
expect a diss

(autotune) nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need breaking things when I steer myself
sometimes new (?)
 
when I steer myself
sometimes new
(autotune)

nothing works mate, kinda get hysterical
i need breaking things when I steer myself
sometimes new (?)
 
when I steer myself
sometimes new

(1/10th part from the back)
ann fran finale

steer myself sometimes new 
just to grasp the heart of ice, melt its dark (melting thrice) (dark)
connection stable 
when you watch me 

(heavy toll paid all i want is you
all you are but let us live in colorized world
till our souls are through)

## Music Video

Meditating (drone footage), connection with other minds while raging inside with emotions.
Mixed with some techwear swag footage + like in the reference graphic - hugging a girl, my face hidden by her hair floating in the air, grasping for each other in red light (motif: danger, aggression).
